<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
<p>Make a e-commerce website with React</p>
<p>Should have different views (pages): Product, Shopping Cart, Product Detail</p>
<ul>
<li>Product name</li>
<li>Serial number</li>
<li>Manufacturer (Optional if only 1 manufacturer)</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Quantity</li>
<li>Product img</li>
</ul>
<p>Search functionality</p>
<p>At least 10 items in inventory</p>
<p>No backend needed. Can use .json file, react state, local storage...</p>

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
<p>Will use figma as a wireframe for the project. Will get ideas of what to make</p>
<p>Will watch lecture videos since they provide some help on certain aspects of project</p>
<p>Google what is needed. Need to look at using material-ui for icons</p>
<p>Many good videos on youtube on useContext for stuff like holding cart price</p>
<p>Found videos on search bar filtering based on parameters</p>
<p>Using json file to hold inventory data since its easier for me to manipulate that data. No need to learn anything else</p>
<p>I can use react-modal for easy modal creation. I can pass product info to modal to show complete info of product</p>
<p>Will try to do advanced/optional functionality if I have time</p>

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
<p>Using figma as base for react project</p>
<p>Watched some good videos on what I am going to use for search and cart functionality</p>
<p>Sort of looking like figma design but it is slightly changing design since I cannot quite get it the same as figma</p>
<p>Things are working so I guess that proves that it is correct</p>

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
<p>Learned a lot from this project. Lots of sweat and tears T.T</p>
<p>Learned more on routing</p>
<p>Learned more on css</p>
<p>Learned about useContext and how to use it to have data between a lot of components (no prop drilling)</p>
<p>Used several libraries that made some things a lot easier</p>
